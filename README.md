### Shito â€” D&D 5e character sheets in your terminal
Shito is a fast, keyboard-driven TUI app built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) for creating, managing, and playing D&D 5e characters. It stores your sheets locally in a SQLite database and helps you roll with the right modifiers.
